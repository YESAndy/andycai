## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student from [ICon Lab](https://intelconstructlab.github.io/index.html) at [the University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I earned my Master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University. 

My research mainly focuses on construction robotics. My current interest is trying to make use of Visual-Language-Model as prior information for robot navigation problems.
